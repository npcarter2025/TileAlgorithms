# Convolution & Cross-Correlation Visualizer

This is the GitHub Pages branch for the [TileAlgorithms](https://github.com/npcarter2025/TileAlgorithms) repository. It contains an interactive visualization tool that helps users understand how convolution and cross-correlation algorithms work in 1D, 2D, and 3D implementations.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations for 1D, 2D, and 3D convolution and cross-correlation
- Compare naive implementations with tiled implementations
- Step-by-step animation of algorithm execution
- Adjustable parameters (array sizes, kernel sizes, tile sizes)
- Choose between convolution and cross-correlation operations

## Usage

Visit the GitHub Pages site at: [https://npcarter2025.github.io/TileAlgorithms/](https://npcarter2025.github.io/TileAlgorithms/)

## Development

This visualizer is built with:
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- D3.js for data visualization
- p5.js for complex rendering (especially in 3D visualizations)

## Folder Structure

- `index.html` - Main page HTML
- `css/` - Styling files
- `js/` - JavaScript code for the visualizations
- `img/` - Static images (if any)
